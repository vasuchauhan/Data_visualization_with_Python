## ðŸ“š Course Overview

In this course, weâ€™ll learn to:

- Create basic charts: line, bar, histogram, pie, box
- Generate specialized charts: waffle, word clouds
- Build interactive dashboards using Plotly and Dash
- Visualize geospatial data with Folium
- Best practices in data storytelling and presentation

Youâ€™ll be working with real datasets and will apply the skills learned to gain insights and make predictions.
